	Added internal method "_belt" to get at the actual belt, for both
	the normal and the throttled belt.

0.03	31 July 2002
	Added internal methods "_freeze" and "_thaw" so that we can move
	to a different serialization scheme or other optimizations without
	having to change all the sub-classes as well.  First user is
	Thread::Conveyor::Monitored.

	Added "maxjobs" and "minjobs" method in Thread::Conveyor that will
	die when they're called (throttling only takes place in
	Thread::Conveyor::Throttled).

	Fixed problem that would cause throttling to not be switched off
	when the "maxjobs" method was specified with an undef value.

	Added methods "clean" and "clean_dontwait" for cleaning the belt
	to both Thread::Conveyor and Thread::Conveyor::Throttled.  Also
	added documentation for it.

	Added internal method "_clean" for obtaining frozen contents of
	the belt to both Thread::Conveyor and Thread::Conveyor::Throttled.
	This was needed for Thread::Conveyor::Monitored.

0.02	30 July 2002
	Adapted Thread::Conveyor to default to a throttled conveyor belt
	automatically if no specific parameters specified.  Now allows for
	specification of throttling settings in a parameter hash reference.
	If unthrottling is specifically specified, returns to the old
	unthrottled behaviour (where the object is just an array reference),
	thus keeping the old execution speed.

	Added helper class Thread::Conveyor::Throttled to allow for throttled
	conveyor belts that block if there are too many boxes on the belt.

	Fixed some documentation nits.

0.01	25 July 2002
	First version of Thread::Conveyor, which started life as
	Thread::Queue::Any.
