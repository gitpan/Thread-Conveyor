	Adapted Thread::Conveyor to default to a throttled conveyor belt
	automatically if no specific parameters specified.  Now allows for
	specification of throttling settings in a parameter hash reference.
	If unthrottling is specifically specified, returns to the old
	unthrottled behaviour (where the object is just an array reference),
	thus keeping the old execution speed.

	Added helper class Thread::Conveyor::Throttled to allow for throttled
	conveyor belts that block if there are too many boxes on the belt.

	Fixed some documentation nits.

	First version of Thread::Conveyor, which started life as
	Thread::Queue::Any.
